# Woah
## A compiler for the Woah language

### Current state of the project
The Woah language is the most complex project I have ever worked on, leading me through
repeated changes in implementation language choice as well as frequent syntax overhauls.
At this point I'm not going to host any syntax documentation because it is likely to
change between now and the project finally being done. Instead I've submitted an 'examples'
directory containing samples of the language using features which I've decided will be kept
as well as a 'C-src' directory containing the C code I wrote up to the point where I realised
this project would be much more effectively written in Haskell.
