# Woah
## A compiler for the Woah language

### Intro
I am designing the Woah language to use all of my favourite features
from all of my favourite languages with the aim of making a fast,
syntactically consistent and, above all, useful systems language. So
far I have a fully functional lexer and now the recursive descent parser
is on its way.

### Syntax
I haven't decided entirely on every element of the syntax but to get a general
feel for what the language is about there are some sample programs in the
examples/ directory
